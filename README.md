<u><h3><center>GoKarting Booking System</center></h3></u>

<h4>What will the application do?</h4>
<p>Its a GUI application using which you will be able to book available time slots to go GoKarting with your friends.
</p>

<h4>Who will use it?</h4>

* The gokarting booking system application can be used by the staff members or administrators of a gokarting facility to
manage and organize bookings for customers who want to participate in gokarting races. Customers can either book
in-person or online, depending on the facility's setup.

* Additionally, the application could potentially be made available to customers themselves, allowing them to browse
available time slots and make bookings online. This would require a user interface that is accessible and easy to use
for customers.

* Overall, the gokarting booking system is designed to streamline the process of managing bookings for gokarting races,
making it easier for both staff members and customers to book, manage, and organize races.

<h4>Why is this project of interest to you?</h4>

* I love F1 and I love Go Karting, but the places in Vancouver where I usually go strangely don't have online booking
systems, so you have to put in your information and phone number, so they can call you and help you
book the time slot you prefer, and then you call them back to cancel it and so on.

<h4>User Stories</h4>

<h4>Phase 4: Task 3</h4>

* I'm not super proud of the current design of my program and to be very honest, I just want to scrap it and do it all over again.
Over the course of doing this project, I learnt a lot of new things and some of which I couldn't implement because I had already
done that using a different method, which may not be as efficient or as clean. But overall, this project was one thing I was having
fun with the entire term, I was always thinking of how to improve it and what other functionalities I could add.
* That brings us on to what all I had thought of doing but couldn't do because of the time constraint:
* I could have added functionalities like Forget Password security questions, Being able to select dates for the booking, maybe some feel-good features, etc.
* As far as refactoring is concerned, I could have refactored the following:
* Helper methods: There are several methods in this code that do more than one thing. To make the code easier to read and understand, 
I could extract some of the functionality into separate methods. For example, I could extract the code that sets up the layout of the main menu into a separate method.
* Reduce coupling: The MainMenu class has too many responsibilities. To reduce coupling and make the code easier to maintain, 
I could extract some of the responsibilities into separate classes.
