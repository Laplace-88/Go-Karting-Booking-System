<u><h3><center>SmartSelect</center></h3></u>
<p>Have you ever bought a car? or a phone? or maybe a laptop, 
headphones, smart watch? Well, ofcourse, you have. 
That means you have atleast once gone through the dilemma 
where you have to choose between 2 or more cars, phones, etc.
It's exhausting, isn't it? Even more for non-technical people
like our parents or grandparents. You go to a car dealer, 
you tell them your budget, you tell them your requirements
and they suggest you a car of that brand, and you buy it.
As if. They give you a list of variants to choose from, 
the variant in your budget doesn't have the features you
want, the variant that has the features you want is a bit
over your budget. Not an issue, just increase your budget
by a bit. But now you realise that in the increased budget
you can buy another car that's bigger or better than this
one. But the base model, if only you increase your budget
a bit more, you could get a higher variant with more 
features, but not all of the ones you want. And this story
ends with you spending more than you would have had to 
spend if you knew that a car from another brand is giving
better value in your initial budget.</p>
<p>What if there was an application that would suggest you
a shortlist of cars, phones, laptops, etc. Presenting
SmartSelect, all you need to make the right choice.</p>

<h4>What will the application do?</h4>
<p>Its a GUI application that will:</p>

* Take your budget range.
* Take your requirements.
* Shortlist the best available options for you.

<h4>Who will use it?</h4>

* People willing to buy a car, phone, laptop, etc.
  who want the best value for their money.

<h4>Why is this project of interest to you?</h4>

* I am a pragmatist. I don't buy any electronic without
  having every technical detail about it. But when I want to
  get into details about such things when its time for me to
  buy one, it's really exhausting to weigh everything and find
  a budget-friendly value-for-money option. This app would
  really come handy in those scenarios.
