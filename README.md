<u><h3><center>GoKarting Booking System</center></h3></u>

<h4>What will the application do?</h4>
<p>Its a GUI application using which you will be able to book available time slots to go GoKarting with your friends.
</p>

<h4>Who will use it?</h4>

* The gokarting booking system application can be used by the staff members or administrators of a gokarting facility to
manage and organize bookings for customers who want to participate in gokarting races. Customers can either book
in-person or online, depending on the facility's setup.

* Additionally, the application could potentially be made available to customers themselves, allowing them to browse
available time slots and make bookings online. This would require a user interface that is accessible and easy to use
for customers.

* Overall, the gokarting booking system is designed to streamline the process of managing bookings for gokarting races,
making it easier for both staff members and customers to book, manage, and organize races.

<h4>Why is this project of interest to you?</h4>

* I love F1 and I love Go Karting, but the places in Vancouver where I usually go strangely don't have online booking
systems, so you have to put in your information and phone number, so they can call you and help you
book the time slot you prefer, and then you call them back to cancel it and so on.
